Two days later, she brought it back, complaining that the radio was not working. \"Madam,\" said the sales manager, \"the audio system in this car is completely automatic. All you need to do is tell it what you want to listen to, and you will hear exactly that!\" She drove out, somewhat amazed and a little confused. She looked at the radio and said, \"Nelson.\" The radio responded, \"Ricky or Willie?\" She was astounded. If she wanted Beethoven, that's what she got. If she wanted Nat King Cole, she got it. She was stopped at a traffic light enjoying \"On the Road Again\" when the light turned green and she pulled out.

      "A little boy goes to his dad and asks, \"What is politics?\" His dad says, \"Well son, let me try to explain it this way: I'm the breadwinner of the family, so let's call me capitalism. Your Mom, she's the administrator of the money, so we'll call her the government. We're here to take care of your needs, so we'll call you the people. The nanny, we'll consider her the working class. And your baby brother, we'll call him the future. Now, think about that and see if that makes sense.\" So the little boy goes off to bed thinking about what dad had said. Later that night, he hears his baby brother crying, so he gets up to check on him. He finds that the baby has severely soiled his diaper. So the little boy goes to his parents' room and finds his mother sound asleep. Not wanting to wake her, he goes to the nanny's room. Finding the door locked, he peeks in the keyhole and sees his father in bed with the nanny. He gives up and goes back to bed. The next morning, the little boy says to his father, \"Dad, I think I understand the concept of politics now.\" The father says, \"Good, son. Tell me in your own words what you think politics is all about.\" The little boy replies, \"Well, while capitalism is screwing the working class, the government is sound asleep, the people are being ignored and the future is in deep shit.\"\n",

When he sits down at the table he notices that a pig is sitting at the table with them for supper and that the pig has a wooden leg. As they are eating and chatting, he eventually asks the farmer why the pig is there and why it has a wooden leg. \"Oh,\" says the farmer, \"that is a very special pig. Last month my wife and daughter were in the barn when it caught fire. The pig saw this, ran to the barn, tipped over a pail of water, crawled over the wet floor to reach them and pulled them out of the barn safely. A special pig like that, you just don't eat it all at once!\"\n",

      "A little boy goes to his dad and asks, \"What is politics?\" His dad says, \"Well son, let me try to explain it this way: I'm the breadwinner of the family, so let's call me capitalism. Your Mom, she's the administrator of the money, so we'll call her the government. We're here to take care of your needs, so we'll call you the people. The nanny, we'll consider her the working class. And your baby brother, we'll call him the future. Now, think about that and see if that makes sense.\" So the little boy goes off to bed thinking about what dad had said. Later that night, he hears his baby brother crying, so he gets up to check on him. He finds that the baby has severely soiled his diaper. So the little boy goes to his parents' room and finds his mother sound asleep. Not wanting to wake her, he goes to the nanny's room. Finding the door locked, he peeks in the keyhole and sees his father in bed with the nanny. He gives up and goes back to bed. The next morning, the little boy says to his father, \"Dad, I think I understand the concept of politics now.\" The father says, \"Good, son. Tell me in your own words what you think politics is all about.\" The little boy replies, \"Well, while capitalism is screwing the working class, the government is sound asleep, the people are being ignored and the future is in deep shit.\"\n",

      "A little boy goes to his dad and asks, \"What is politics?\" His dad says, \"Well son, let me try to explain it this way: I'm the breadwinner of the family, so let's call me capitalism. Your Mom, she's the administrator of the money, so we'll call her the government. We're here to take care of your needs, so we'll call you the people. The nanny, we'll consider her the working class. And your baby brother, we'll call him the future. Now, think about that and see if that makes sense.\" So the little boy goes off to bed thinking about what dad had said. Later that night, he hears his baby brother crying, so he gets up to check on him. He finds that the baby has severely soiled his diaper. So the little boy goes to his parents' room and finds his mother sound asleep. Not wanting to wake her, he goes to the nanny's room. Finding the door locked, he peeks in the keyhole and sees his father in bed with the nanny. He gives up and goes back to bed. The next morning, the little boy says to his father, \"Dad, I think I understand the concept of politics now.\" The father says, \"Good, son. Tell me in your own words what you think politics is all about.\" The little boy replies, \"Well, while capitalism is screwing the working class, the government is sound asleep, the people are being ignored and the future is in deep shit.\"\n",
