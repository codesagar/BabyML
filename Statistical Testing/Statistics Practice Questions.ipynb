When Google places an ad for a company with its search results, the company pays a fee to Google each time someone clicks on the link. That’s fine when it’s a person who’s interested in buying a product or service, but not so good when it’s a computer program pretending to be a customer. An analysis of **1200 clicks** coming into a company’s site during a week identified that **175 of these clicks are fraudulent**. Compute the confidence interval with **95% confidence** for the proportion of fraudulent clicks. "
