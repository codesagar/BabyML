

Hello Everyone,


I hope you guys are having a fabulous week. This will be the last weekend in our journey together in exploring basic techniques in data sciences.

On Saturday, we will talk about methods that help us with dimensionality reduction and/or reduce the risk of overfitting.
- Principal component analysis
- Regularization
- Naive Bayes Algorithm


Sunday's class is going to densely packed with new material- we shall explore basic time series analysis methods. We will be starting with simple way of incorporating seasonality in data and quickly ramp to more advanced methods like  Holt-Winters. We will finish the class with a discussion of Arima methods.

As always, the best way to prepare for the weekends class is to look back at the lecture notes and lab work from last week.

Thx
-Anand
